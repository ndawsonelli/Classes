Programming Homeworks
The purpose of this repository is to:
1) learn Github and practice version control and change tracking
2) create and put into practice a failsafe to ensure minimal work is lost when a local save file is corrupted during file saving in Maple Classic when the program crashes during a save and corrupts the file.
